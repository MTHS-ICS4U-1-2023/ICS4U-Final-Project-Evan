This repository is the development of my web app.

It is seperated into two folders:

 - Audio Processing

 - Flask Web App

As I am able to get my audio processing algorithms and complex mathemetical stuff working in the terminal I then get it working with flask, this is why I seperate the two folders. 

Each folder has different versions, as my code eventually develops into a more final product. Here is more information on the different day by day working of these versions.

After I finishes the project I used Google Cloud Platforms (instead of AWS) to deploy my project on a server. 

Here is the repo that runs the server: https://github.com/evan-beaudoin99/Final_Project_GCP
